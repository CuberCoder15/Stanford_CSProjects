# BoxOfProduce

Complete two classes:

1. BoxOfProduce.java (See instructions in the javadoc of the source code.)
2. BoxOfProduceMain.java (Write a main method that tests the functionality of your BoxOfProduce class/data type. As long as you test each method in your BoxOfProduce class at least once, you will earn full credit for this part.)


Submit the two files to codePost for testing and grading.

A sample text file, produce.txt, is also included if you'd like to use this one (or make your own).

If you are having trouble writing code that reads input from a text file, copy and paste the piece of starter code from the Benford's Law program:
